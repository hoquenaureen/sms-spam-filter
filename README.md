# SMS - Spam or Not Spam?
we were given a set of labelled SMS messages [1] and the main goal was to
implement two basic machine learning techniques (k-nearest neighbors and multinomial Naive Bayes)
without using third-party libraries such as scikit-learn, then use them on this dataset to detect if an SMS
message is spam or non-spam (also known as "ham"). 
We implemented these classifiers within a Jupyter notebook which can be opened in Jupyter-compatible
environments like Google Colab. Our notebook requires the following Python libraries: matplotlib,
numpy, pandas, seaborn , and requests . Further instructions on executing the code can be found within
Markdown cells in the notebook file.
